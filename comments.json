Just tell the truth, if the guy gets off because there's no video evidence, oh well, it was just a drug charge.\n\nThis is the problem with law enforcement in the U.S., police are at the very least socially punished if they don't catch a guy and get charges to stick, if not professionally punished for failing to do so. But law enforcement is not always about forcing a process to happen, sometimes the process should just stop before a conviction, and that's still justice."

    "commentText": "To all of those struggling with depression:\nAbout 6 months ago on January 13 I lost my older brother due to a house fire. My life seems to be spiraling downwards ever since that god awful day that will forever be in my head. Everyday I think of my brother and I want to see him so bad, and everyday it gets harder and harder to bare with. I wouldn't say I have clinical depression, because I haven't really cared to go in to see, but every time I wake up I'm reminded that I will never get to see him and that depresses me. The point of this is that no matter what you're going through, either its the loss of a loved one, abuse(any kind), your size, so on and so on. You only have one life on this Earth, and that means no matter what you will always have you. When life seems like it won't get any better, tell yourself that doesn't matter because every bad thing that you have been through can and will change you. It's your decision that will tell if you grow from the experience or wallow in it. You CAN make it through anything, and here is proof.\n\nMy life as a young lad wasn't the best, but I never knew that because my mom kept secrets from me (for obvious reasons of course, I'd do the same). My father was and still is a struggling addict. He was abusive to my mother because of this. We always had just enough money to get by, and my mother (the strongest woman I know) managed to raise three kids doing so. Years went by until she remarried, and this seemed to change things a bit. we had a little more money but payments really put a damper on the cream supply. For me life was going good, a middle schooler with friends and  pretty much everything I ever needed. At this time I knew about our money situation, but not about my dad. I would still visit him on weekends until I got to high school. When I was in 9th grade my mom had to break to me the news that my dad was going to jail for robbery and possession of a controlled substance. I was heart broken knowing that my dad, the person I looked up to in life was a criminal. I would still visit him on weekends, but this time it was only for 20 minutes and behind glass talking through a phone. When he got out five months later he went to rehabilitation. In there he would get caught with pain killers and sent back to jail. As a teenager I used this for humor. Often I would make jokes about it, because it made me feel better, as I did with being poor. Eventually my dad got out again, and this time he had his mind set on getting better. Dispite his mind set he eventually went back to jail. We've reached 11th grade, and both of my brothers were, \"moved out\" (I say that because the rest of our family moved to a different house and they stayed) the year was going by smoothly. I no longer cared about my dad being a criminal drug addict, but I'd still make jokes about it because it would get a few laughs. A few weeks after Christmas my brothers (Alan 20, Joseph 21, Me 16) went to visit their father in Texas (we have different dads) and needed someone to watch the house, me being the easiest choice, was glad to do it. I would use this week to have a great time throwing parties and getting rickety rickety rekt. I had my fun, and Alan came home so I was no longer needed. (Joe went to Arizona for some reason) A few days past and I was on my way to school with my friend who picked me up when I got a call from Joe, who was on his way back, asking if I had talked to Alan the night before or if I knew if he was home. I had no idea why he was asking this so I asked. He told me the house was on fire and he didn't know if Alan went to a friends house or if he was in the house. I didn't know, and I certainly didn't know how serious the fire was. I though maybe something caught fire and the firefighters could easily put it out. Never the less I messaged all the friends who I had numbers of. It wasn't until five minutes into second period when my teacher got a call. I instantly knew something was up, and started getting really worried. He hung up the phone and looked at me, and I knew I had to go. Walking down to the school office I saw my step dad standing there and I walked out with him. We didn't say a word until we got outside when he told me my brother died in that house fire. A few months of dealing with that and all the pity looks I got at school I found out my dad went back to jail again, but this time with 3 felonies and a misdemeanor. Cut to now and I'm about to start my senior year."

At the same time we need to accept the probable cause for police officers to see danger and vulnerable situtations. Continued gun regulation and supported government training towards conflict resolution can make this possible.

He's a man who helped create the Tea Party, which made the Republicans the sad extremists they are today. And he's a man who when confronted with people he denied healthcare to, from his own state no less, told them their best solution was to move out of said state. McCain literally has the same kind of brain cancer which killed a few of his constituents who he denied healthcare to. Americans died, continue to die, and will die in the future because of his decisions. This is true both while he is in office and in the ground years down the line.

The abuses that he chronicled were never addressed and police everywhere still insist, one and all, that civilian oversight is unnecessary.  Of COURSE it's necessary.  Police States are terrible places for everyone and nobody would want their children raised in an atmosphere of falsehood, evidence tampering, and bipartisan hate messages.  \nPut simply, but accurately, Police are wolves hired to protect sheep, like Hackers are hired to protect computer security.

They clearly didn't know about the 30 seconds prior, otherwise they wouldn't have recreated the scene. If they did know, they would've waited a bit before doing it. Police are people too, and if this was just a normal every-day blue collar job, people would do the same thing; in my last job I'd get stuff done outside of typical bureaucratic channels just because it's faster, then once I got the result I'd fill out the proper forms and paperwork so it's documented. \n\nIf the police spend a lot of time searching, officers may have started recording early. The devices have limited space, as made clear by the 30 second footage buffer before deleting. They clearly had footage from earlier on. If you're not paranoid and anti-police, it very clearly looks like they started the footage, it ended because it was taking too long, then when they found it they realized the bodycam wasn't active for when it was found. Based solely on that video, there's nothing to suggest that he planted evidence at all. Proof that he planted evidence would mean that there's proof that he took unrelated drugs from outside of the location and brought it in."

What if you thought (be it wrong or right) that McCain sold out his fellow soldiers in Vietnam and that resulted in their torture and death?\n\nWell, my mother is one of those people. It's unfortunate that she believes many crazy things, but she is not a horrible human being. Far from it in fact. Her compassion for others is what has informed mine. So much so, that while I don't condone her wishing McCain had died from cancer, I certainly won't condemn her for it.\n\nNo, the way to solve this problem is not to harshly condemn and talk down to those who believe in ridiculous nonsense, but to research the mechanisms that allow a person to hold irrational beliefs in the first place, so that we can prevent others from suffering from them and maybe even cure those who currently do. Of course, that's a much harder approach to take and people are supremely lazy.

At best, this officer was fabricating evidence for the court to use to put this man in a cage for a longer time or to negate plea negotiations if he was guilty. Let's say the officer did find these drugs there and decided to recreate the video - just finding the drugs leaves the defense open to a lot of options for plea deal negotiations and arguing in court - they can claim the officer may have planted the drugs, the officer may have found drugs somewhere other than he said, etc... they can question his character and question the legitimacy of his claims. But by faking video evidence, he is removing the individual's rights to a fair and speedy trial by creating evidence that did not exist in order to make a better case for the prosecutor. \n\nSo at best, what he did was still a massive violation of rights and he needs to be put in jail for it. At worst, he actively tried to kidnap someone via proxy (put them in a cage for no reason, under the guise of government authority) and should be brought up on those charges. It's about time we hold police to the same standard that we hold everyone else."

The cop tampered with evidence - he manufactured a fraudulent video with the intention of using said video as evidence in a Court of law.  Moreover, the prosecution would have used that video to pressure the defendant into coping to a plea bargain thus undermining his right to a fair trial.  This is not a one off.  Cops and Prosecutors use similar techniques all the time as a way to deny defendants their right to due process which is one of our most important and fundamental rights.  Know this.  If you are ever accused of anything, there will be no trial of your peers.  Why - because they will pull tricks like this and present a case that looks so bad for you, you wouldn't dare roll the dice on a trial and receive years in the pen.  You think you can beat the rap - guess again.  They know how to \"interview\" (read coach up) witnesses.  They know how to get people to remember seeing things that never happened, and they can and will convince people you are a menace to society before even beginning the \"interview\" to see if anyone saw something that can help them \"do their job and keep people safe.\"  Everyone involved in law enforcement needs criminals to keep the funds flowing and when there aren't enough criminals, they invent them because it's that or the unemployment line and that's not happening so someone is going to jail.

That said, I think we need to remember who we're talking about. John McCain gave up five years of his life fighting in an imperialist war his country had no business being a part of anyway. That makes him a war hero. But McCain also supported the US' intervention in Iraq; another imperialist war that sent many more young people to their deaths, or to become similar \"war heros\". I want to be clear, I respect those who fight in wars, because it means I don't have to fight in them myself. But I have no respect for those that start wars, especially on the other side of the world. \n\nAs to the people who died due to McCain's support in the cutting of healthcare funding, that also makes me lose respect for the man. When someone dies as a result of someone else's actions, that is, at the very least, involuntary manslaughter. \n\nMy point is: he's dying painfully, and that is a fate I don't wish on anyone. It's a hard experience for him and for his family, and I truly wish he weren't in this predicament. However, that doesn't mean we have to respect him."

Cop then says he's going to check over here and his buddies laugh knowingly. He puts on a show digging through the garbage before he \"finds\" the drugs. I don't really care what the cop claims after that point because what he's got right there is called \"reasonable doubt\". The prosecution knew they couldn't make any case now so they had to drop the charges. \n\nWe all know what would have happened if this cop had waited an extra ten seconds before activating his body camera. This right here is just one more reason people don't trust cops. Why so many of us say they need to have always on body cameras, always recording always uploading to backup servers so that data pileup doesn't create a situation where the body camera isn't working. There should be no excuse for why one second of a cop's on-duty time is not being recorded. If we the citizens can't trust the police, and we absolutely can't, then we need to be able to hold them accountable when they abuse their power. To do that we have to prevent them from keeping these things secret. I know every cop isn't a criminal, but the fact is that plenty of them are and we have no way of knowing who is who unless they get caught on video. Even then it doesn't always make a difference in court but at least we the people will know."

He should have not published anything in the first place, because it's \"private\" (not as a nude picture or anything, but still, its \"sensitive\" information) but i agree he didn't make any threats or was derogatory at all so i just perceive from its cynical value, so its pretty damn funny. This is not about feminism \"being an excuse\" for misconduct. If you think that's how it is, you are just as wrong as she was. Nor men nor women should do anything like that to somebody else.\n\nThis is about people believing they have the right to some sort of \"revenge\" over others just because they felt attacked or offended (without it being the actual case). And these types of loopholes just make it easier for people to try and seek vengeance or whatever instead of being adults about it. The university also played a huge part in making this unnecessary personal drama blow waaay up. Its almost like they are showcasing it. The \"punishments\" he received were uncalled for and quite frankly stupid (an essay of what you did wrong? it sounds like something you'd ask a little kid to do if he punched another one).\n\nNothing within a person's private life, unless actually being dangerous to themselves or others, should inflict in their right to an education and free speech. Yes, this must have been humiliating for her but a) she was in the wrong (doesnt deserve to be 'punished' for it either, but its important to state that) b)it could have been anyone, just like phil said c) quite frankly his review was honest and he only asked for evidence to back up her statements, which seems perfectly logical when somebody broke your trust.\n\nThis whole thing is stupid and \"privileged\" and should have gone nowhere in the first place. We have all laughed at situations or memes of people treating their exes like we secretly want to and nobody takes offense for it. I think she must be one of those people who deflect responsibility and are better at playing victims. It has nothing to do with her being a woman and any \"favoritism\" or favorable treatment \"girls\" get when they are \"hurt\".

I don't distrust because I have nothing to hide.  I distrust because I don't want to be arrested for something I didn't know about, like planted evidence."

This is an example where \"check your privilege\" is NO adequate answer towards a \"white cis male\".

Anyway, I certainly can speak to the feeling that I have, and I imagine others have, when it comes to getting help. It does make me feel weak, it feels like giving up, like I can't handle life without professional help. I see everyone else going about their day, doing things that give me anxiety like it's nothing, it all seems so easy. It feels like there's a part of my brain that's out of whack. Like the anxiety parts are too easily turned on. There's a disconnect between reality and how my brain is reacting to reality. I feel broken. I know I need help but it's like admitting the biggest failure, just not being able to live life like a normal person. \n\nP.S. I'm not looking for sympathy here, my problems are largely my own making. I'm just trying to point out that just the act of seeking help is really difficult for some. It's feels like making the problem worse in a strange sense because it makes it \"official\" for lack of a better word, when a medical professional is introduced."

I was a Mexican scholarship kid at that school in ultra-conservative AZ, and many parents made me feel as if I didn't belong there. He, however, was always kind and warm, and so were his sons. I'm a liberal minded individual, I haven't always agreed with his policies, but I fundamentally believe that John McCain is a good man. I can only put out well wishes to him and his family."

I'm devastated, many people  knock Linkin Park for being angsty abd whiny but that music, Chester's story of battling addiction and depression helped me through the several years of my life where i literally had a gun to my head on more than one occasion, and when  i was fighting to stop taking painkillers. His music saved my life in a real tangible way. I have never been so deeply upset and floored by a \"celebrity death\" before this. I know i speak for many out there when i say that Chester will be sorely missed. A man who contributed so much to my life and undoubtably many others died and I honestly don't know where to go from here. What a going to piss me off the most is to see companies exploiting his death for sales, like we've seen countless times before with so many entertainers deaths.

Secondly the issue with the police arrests and killings seem less racial and more to do with opertunity. By less racial, I do not think that the police force is explicitly racist, but trying to use the stigma that is already apparent around the black community to make more arrests to fill a quota for a bonus that they are probably getting from private prisons. It is my opinion that, thanks to the wages that they get from the state, or Federal Government in the case of those like state troopers, not being sufficient to maintain their families, or life styles, they are lead to gain extra funds through more controversial or even down right illegal means. Thus it can be said that the string of violence committed by law enforcement is all because of those who run our government being greedy bastards."

Do I think he should have been suspended? Eh, I'm iffy on it. I think that the punishment is a little extreme, but I do think there should have been some sort of punishment.

He's always struck me as a good guy , and we know he isn't afraid to call out one of his own. On most issues, he gives the impression of being a fairly moderate individual, but it did really disappoint in 2008 when his campaign decided they had to bring Sarah Palin on to the team to try and get back all of those people he lost by not reenforcing those irrational fears. Looking back now, considering the fact that the strategy didn't work out for him, I wonder what he regrets more...not going harder (and lower) in order to get the win, or opening Pandora's box by bringing on Palin to try and make that voting block feel like their often irrational and baseless fears and concerns were valid and legitimate...because you can't deny that Palin gave that group someone to rally around and the perception of a shared loss to rage against that redefined the political climate in America for the entirety of Obama's presidency, paving the way for the election we all just had to live through."

There's always two sides two a story and judging by the context of the video and statement releases we cannot draw a definitive conclusion yet... Just don't hold your breath is all I'm saying. The brotherhood that exists among officers is real and more than likely the IA investigation will spin it to no wrongdoing but we're not wrong for questioning this whether Yoir support the police or not. One bad apple spoils the bunch. \n\n\nAnd for nick.. He graded a letter. People are so sensitive about things nowadays. It's not revenge porn... Right? Plus she cheated on him... Allegedly. What about his feelings you cucks? They don't matter because he's a man? Has she ever aired him out on social media? People don't look at the larger picture nowadays.. So many unanswered things here but they took it too far with probation and uhh.. Excuse my language but fuck his university. Credit transfer and graduate elsewhere. Do you really want a diploma from a school that made you do a presentation on a Twitter post? Fuck. Off. Society. Grow a pair of. Balls. Shit happens. He didn't physically harm her, he didn't yell or swear or lie. He posted.. On twitter. Maybe he has friends on Twitter and he wanted to expose her fake feelings?

And thanks for talking about depression, as a person who's dealt with depression for most of my life, I appreciate when people don't demonize it, and show people that there is a way out, there is help.  Poor Chester, I feel for his wife and his 6 children who will miss him."

He's handling a baggie of drugs he found on the ground in a dump without wearing any gloves, sets it down, covers it, walks out of the scene and cones back to the spot to recover it. They never clarify in the audio recording if it was indeed a restaging of the location to show where they found the evidence, he just basically goes \"A-ha!\" And holds up the bag. There are two possible realities that the video reveals about the Baltimore officers in that video. 1) If it was true that they recovered that bag from the site in that manner, they handled it improperly and staged the site with no verbal communication to indicate the method in which they discovered the drugs in the first place. 2) In the worst case, which is looking more plausible now, they found that bag somewhere not on that site and planted it there. So they are faced with being found either incompetent or corrupt. Not a particularly good PR move on their part, especially given the heat from the DOJ for relaxing regulations and oversight for civil forfeiture cases. America has a real problem in its justice system, where convictions are driven by profit, not by guilt or proven innocence. Police officers wield so much power. But it isn't something we should just resignedly hand over to them. It's earned through trust and demonstrated concern and care for the communities they serve. Incidents like this erode that trust, no matter how ethical and transparent other cops on the force are."

Because \"in the end nothing else matters\" but the love and joy he has brought to my also crazy, insane, dark cloud that is my life. I have always found solace in Linkin Park, since I was a teenager and he will be missed by many. He had a beautiful voice and could scream with the best of them. Even if you are the one dealing with the demons it sometimes is easier to find an out than find help. And those that have these feelings and issues really need to bond with someone that can truly understand a family member or friend. Doctors can be intimidating, and why a lot of people don't want or like going and that stigma of needing help needs to be lifted from our society. There is too much death and destruction in the world and people who are too selfish to just listen. Truly listen when their loved one is begging for attention and help. I wish his family the best and losing a friend the same way only a couple months ago must have been his trigger, Chris Cornell might have been the one person he could relate to mentally.

That's actually kind of the opposite of depression. If you want to understand depression, think of the most apathetic you've ever been about anything, ever. Now multiply that by 100. Depression means waking up some days and honestly feeling like the world could burn today and maybe I might piss on the flames, if I don't just jump in first. I honestly think that's why a lot of the most creative people are manic depressive. When you deal with that, you go to greater lengths to do/accomplish things simply to feel something. Unfortunately, that also lends itself to drug/alcohol abuse. I know that first hand.

There is a massive buildup, a biological process in the brain. Logic gets twisted and reality starts meaning something completely different when you struggle for a long time. Its not that fucking easy to  handle.\n\nIf you dont know what you are talking about, then shut the fuck up. \n\nOn another note, the buildup from depression leading to suicide can also be reversed with the right help. The first and most important step is to seek help. Talk to someone. Don't feel guilty about your problems, it's not your fault. But don't give up either.

What about the 53 other ones? \n\nHe was just used as a witness by a prosecutor? That should have never been allowed in the first place. These are potentially innocent people's futures at risk. I'm not educated enough in the legal system to know the best way to deal with those 53 other cases. I only hope it's dealt with in a fair and just way. I mean, actually fair and just. I personally think he didn't look too uncomfortable doing what he did, and I have a reasonable reason to believe he did plant evidence. So, what else is he capable of? Lying? I have a reasonable reason to believe that, as I believe he planted evidence which is a very cruel and blatant way to lie. Anyone who can do that to another human being & their family should be fired. However, since there's small but nonetheless reasonable doubt to believe he didn't plant it, I suppose that's why they went with suspicion. MAYBE. \n\nI hope any other people he's possibly help to put in jail have their chance in court once again. Since now, there's certainly a reasonable doubt that they're truly guilty. He looked pretty comfortable and confident doing what he did. There's no reason to do what he did if one is doing the right thing. Like Phil said, hit record when you find the drugs. Placing them and acting out finding them is and should feel dirty. As it's manipulation of a jury via manipulation of the facts/truth. \n\nAs far as the rest, I agree. \n\nWith Senator John McCain... Wishing death upon someone out of differencing opinions is vile. \n\nNot to mention how many lives have been taken away by cancer, and to wish even 1 more, to me, is egregious. \nI don't care what your political stance is. \n\nI wish the best for senator John McCain and hope for his full recovery. I also hope his family is doing the best they can in these difficult circumstances and that they kind find peace of mind knowing he's doing well right now."

John McCain has been my Senator for many years, and let me tell you, this guy is one huge steaming pile of shit, always has been, and always will be.The nicest thing I can bear to say about him is that he is an opportunist.This is a guy who crashed not one, not two, but three planes in Vietnam. Any other pilot and there is an investigation after one crash, and you're grounded after 2. Not this \"maverick\". Oh no, nepotism kept him in the air.So then, this fuckwad comes home only to find that his beautiful wife had been horribly disfigured in a car accident. Oh, but don't worry, he found the mental fortitude to divorce her and marry the heiress to a beer distribution company a mere 6 weeks later. This from an advent supporter of California's Prop 8 and other \"defend the sanctity of marriage\" hogwash.So now he's got the girl, got the cash, what next? Oh right, run for Senate. Afterall, he's a \"war hero\" after spending 6 years in a Hanoi Hilton. Let's ignore the fact that his own brashness and bravado is what got him there. But before running for Senate, as a Congressman he needs to vote against MLK Day being recognized by Arizona.Where are we? Only up to 1989. Ever hear of the Keating Five?I haven't even gotten to his fuckery in regards to Benghazzzzzzzi, DADT, flipping his position on PPACA, and I guarantee you he will be the furthest from reason as the GOP tries to wedge itself into immigration reform.Don't kid yourself. McCain never was, and never will be a decent man. He has ridden the coat tails of being a POW, faux patriotism, and having an 'R' next to his name in a very red state to some weird conglomeration of Senatorial celebrity. He's fucked my state, he continues to fuck our nation, and I'm tired of this myth of \"well, he was a good man until Bush/Rove got to him\" being perpetuated.

One night after class (took night class at community college cause i worked during the day) I got pulled over. I was polite and cooperated, after talking for a few minuets it became apparent the officer didnt believe I was on my way home from school because of the time 11pm. So he asks me to step out the vehicle, Which I did cause I was just trying to comply so I could get home it had been a long day. AS soon as I got out the truck this 6ft+ obese grown man bows up to me, (im about 5'11 130lbs soaking wet at the time) and gets all in my face. Stating: \"You better tell me what you have now boy\" \"Ima find what you're hiding boy\" Literally pushing against me, yelling in my face. Being 19 at the time it literally shocked me, Of coarse I got nervous. He continues, \"why you scared boy?\" \"How much dope have you had BOY?\" He then continued to dump all my school binders out onto the ground, and absolutely WRECKED my truck. Just almost seemingly tried to fuck it all up. After finding nothing he has the nerve to tell me \"YOU GOT LUCKY TONIGHT BOY\". Then left me along a busy highway to collect my important school paperwork from blowing away... NOW I KNOW not all cops are like this, but now when I hear of a cop being killed its sad but I like to hope it was one of THOSE kinda cops at least :/ INB4 RACE CARD, IM A WHITE MALE. Dorchester/ North Charleston cops are notorious ass holes. I used to believe that if you just do what your supposed to youll be fine.. yea thats BS\n\n**UPDATE** Some people seem to get the impression I hate police, and enjoy seeing them die.. Thats disgusting and could not be further from the truth. I have multiple family members in law enforcement. I share this experience so you understand not every one is perfect, and cops can make mistakes like any other human.

Spencer believes his actions didn't benefit America, and hindered them. So, from Spencer's perspective, which can't be invalidated due to it being his opinion, McCain is essentially a cause of evil. \n\nAnd sure, McCain has done INDIVIDUAL acts of kindness, but over all, does that make up for his support of the military industrial complex, and being a direct senior member in the senate that supported wars the American people did not? This is not a left or right issue. \n\nWhether McCains INTENT was right, or not, he didn't really help the US, as a nation, at all? Many also feel his direct choice of Palin costed the election, and gave Obama 8 years to destroy this country. So why WOULDN'T spencer hate the guy? it's kind of absurd to suggest otherwise, since from Spencer's mind, McCain is literally Mussolini....I imagine the left leaning author feels the same, although I'm not familiar with her. \n\nNow, the problem with Spencer is that he takes it too extreme. Why WISH PAIN. You shouldn't wish pain on hitler, let alone McCain. No one is deserving of physical pain. Nor is McCain deserving of death, although, due to the fact McCain HAS POLITICIZED HIS DEATH (by going against his own decision to retire soon, seeming to pull a Ted Kennedy on the senate). It's like people NOT wishing for the death of a Right Leaning Justice. Hmm Justice Scalia maybe?\n\nListen, the point is, in politics your life is literally part of the politics. So it's not that heartless to politicize someones death in this manner, the person CHOSE TO DO THAT by bringing their life into the matter at all. McCain could just retire? So could Ruth Bader, but she's specifically choosing to stay on the Supreme Court till her last breath just to avoid dying on Trump's team. So is it wrong for people to WANT her to die? Eh? It's hard to make such a moral judgement Phil. You should be a bit more moderate on this in my view."

Their music helped me through my shitty childhood and it might be fair to say that if they weren't around, maybe I wouldn't be either. I usually don't get upset over celebrity deaths but this has seriously shocked me. It's like a childhood friend of mine has just died.  Someone who helped me through the lowest point in my life and continued to support me throughout the toughest hours. Rest in Peace, Chester Bennington.

I watched an interview with him recently, where when he was asked about the recent health care bill, he said he was voting for it b/c it was important for all Republicans to do so, even though he had not read it.\n\nI'm not surprised at his diagnosis given how at some recent hearings he was completely incoherent and rambling nonsense. I wish him no personal ill will and unfortunately know what it's like to have an older family member battle cancer, so I hope he recovers, but I feel like the government might be better without him in it. Although... given our current state of affairs, he'll likely be replaced with someone even worse."

Even if I was no longer an active follower of their music they still were amazing artists. I'm kinda still stunned and I hope nothing but the best for his family and band mates."

Honestly all three of them need to be dismissed at the least, if they were just recreating then it's unfortunate that they made a poor decision at least they aren't being charged with falsifying evidence. Also these body cameras need to be on ALL THE TIME, it's absurd the officer gets to choose when they want to record.

Or did they bring it with them, just in case they didn't find anything, and they wanted to get this guy by any means necessary, or are they telling some version of what actually happened?

I think there needs to be a police force that actively searches for cops breaking the law, and Iam not talking about Internal Affairs. I mean an actual force that you can call in your jurisdiction that will send out a response officer to oversee police if you feel you're being harassed. And even ticket police for speeding or using their phone while driving, just little shit that they do because they think they're  above the law.

It's easy to tell someone to seek help without considering the consequences of them doing so. I now owe the ER I was brought to several hundred dollars on top of owing the psych hospital $800. I got put on a brand new medication that is difficult to adjust and have been \"marked\" with an official diagnosis. I'm in a therapy group that is costing me even more money to attend. Though I know these are positive steps towards wellness they are not easy and NOT inexpensive or without strings. It's not easy to seek help.

I learned that just because I disagree with a person, does not automatically make them a bad person, but instead a one with different opinion.

He served this country on the battlefield of war and in the battlefield of politics. It's beyond disgusting to see some ungrateful and utterly disgusting garbage be spewed out by Milo Yiannopoulos saying \"now we know his thinking behind his 20 years of political service.\" This is not only beyond insulting but it shows that the people of Arizona were pleased with his service enough to get reelected compared to Milo to seek out negative attention and infamy. For some people on the right, McCain is an idol and an inspiration. Personally, in my opinion, I think it's extremely admirable for McCain that when he passes, which is going to be a sad day indeed, he will die doing something he is utmost passionate about whereas Milo will become that troll with no empathy throwing snide comments as he does that flawlessly."

Through college i worked for a colosseum in Louisiana, an event center in my town. We hosted big events, such as Rodeos, basketball games, etc. Worked there for 2 years as a technician, and handled managing events. Yea so thats great and all, until one event, a \"police appreciation\" crawfish boil, and i put that in quotes because of this. It had all good intentions, open to the public, and speeches by the sheriff and staff. Yet, underneath all this good intention, the real reason for this event was to run a re-election campaign for the Sheriff, NEVER once mentioned to any person paying for tickets. THE SCHEME GETS DEEPER, the state owns the facility i worked for, so the entire facility charge, and ticket percentages were all dropped, a completely free event for the sheriff. After the event in our meeting we reported over 2.5 million dollars worth of tickets were sold. And the facility got nothing for it. This seems unfair for his opponents, he was funded by the state for re-election, which is extremely dubious."

Depression runs in my family but at least then (I'm 23 now) no one taught me what depression was in school. There were nights I had considered taking my own life because I didn't see a reason to stay, but music was a major outlet for me and bands like Linkin Park resonated with me on a personal level. Luckily (yes I say luckily) my high school was testing a new depression screening survey when I was 16, 17, and without knowing it I scored fairly high. I was able to get the help I needed and went through therapy, and honestly it changed my life. Chester's passing broke me, I found out through the car radio and broke down in my car. I was supposed to see him live next week for the first time, it was going to be a dream come true. I can only hope that addressing his suicide will bring light to the situation, and that we can continue to better educate about depression and suicide. I applaud people like you who have some limelight, who address such sensitive topics and who spread awareness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing what you do, and for talking about these unfortunate tragedies when they occur. I will copy it here just in case anyone who could use it sees this: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7: 1-800-273-8255.

You could easily have a camera that streams data to the cruiser,  the data transfered to the respective departments system, and finally to the courts. Ideally you'd want them to be accessible to the public however I do understand how cases work and evidence needs to be preserved for a proper trial. Yes there are security protocols that would need to be used, but ask yourself this, would you rather pay a bit more in taxes for these types of tools, so your local law enforcement could be held accountable when they do justly duties AND when they commit unlawful acts?, or pay less and continue to see our local, state and federal law enforcement get away with what is clearly wrongful and illegal practice. \n\nI for one can honestly say I do not trust the law enforcement agencies in this country any more.

Never any outward signs either, always the most friendly and caring goofball around both crew and fans. \nThis was a few years ago, and helped me realize that mental health issues don't discriminate, and just because you think someone seems well off, it doesn't mean they don't have struggles of their own."

However, he is a good example of what politicians should be like. He very much humanizes himself constantly and I hope he gets well."

Cos that's basically what they're saying\" and that just earns my respect because he knows enough not to assume the worst of people. Do I agree on his stance on alot of things?

I lost my father last September to glioblastoma and though he fought for 1 year 7 months he couldn't win the fight.  Senator McCain will have a huge fight and most likely have to head to a research study and hope his tumor matches what they need.  They will also try radiation and chemotherapy which is a double edged sword.  Some glioblastoma can completely ignore this treatment and grow extremely fast while others might slow in the amount of growth.  A person can go through multiple surgeries to extend their time like my father went under the knife twice.  Personally I hope Senator McCain finds a research study that helps him and recovers.  It's a horrible thing to watch a loved one go through this and my prayers go out to him and his family."

Obviously it is unfortunate, but for many years, I respected him and what he stood for. I didn't necessarily agree with it all the time, but I couldn't deny that he was a great human being. I didn't vote (partially because I couldn't for a while due to my age) for him but I am currently one of his constituents. A few years ago (maybe as far back as 6 or 7 years ago), I had seen many things in terms of interviews and statements from John McCain that seemed off. They didn't seem like the honorable man I had respected. Things that seemed immature or like poor judgement that he'd backpedal on the next day. They weren't really frequent at first but slowly became more and more often. It made me worried because they were things that made me question my respect for him as a politician. Sometimes they were things that seemed like he didn't even understand what he was saying. Then there was that issue not too long ago about the slurred, almost drunken questioning of Comey. Just having something that I could use to explain the change I saw in him made me feel better because it meant that I didn't misplace my original confidence in him. I hope he is doing better."

Even Robin Williams, someone that brought so much joy to the world, decided to take his own life. It's up to friends, family, and maybe even fans (in this case) to recognize a problem and do something... anything. Something is better then nothing. Especially when some of his most recent lines are \"I don't like my mind right now,\" \"why is everything so heavy,\" and probably the most famous line of \"in the end, nothing even matters.\" 7 people I know committed suicide in one year while I was in high school. Sometimes a simple \"hey let's talk for a bit,\" or a \"hey, I'm worried about you,\" could save a life. I wish I could have done it for the people I knew."

    "commentText": "As someone who has a couple anxiety disorders, and has struggled with depression his whole life, I would just like to take a second and emphasize how important Phill's comment that if you are struggling, to please go get help, is. My whole life I battled my depression on my own, starting way back in middle school. I used to pride myself on pulling through it without the need of any help. But I was so wrong, because as soon as my life went to shit, my depression gave me a massive bunch to the gut that left me gasping for air. Conceding on my pride, and seeing a psychiatrist for the first time in my life at age 20, was the best decision I ever made. The medicine and advice she has given me have been invaluable. She probably saved my life. If you are out there struggling right now, please please please go get help. It's ok, it doesn't make you weak, or stupid, or silly. It makes you smart, and brave, and strong. It takes courage to open yourself up and admit you need help. If medicine scares you, then see a therapist instead. If therapists scare you, at least find a person you can confide in. any help is better than no help. You may feel like you're drowning now, but with a helping hand you can be pulled out of the story seas yet. Don't give up hope."

Unless you've been in that head space its really hard to understand the complex thought processes and the soul crushing utter despair someone experiences as they head down that path. Anything positive you experience gets trivialised, minimised and snuffed out, while anything negative takes on gargantuan proportions and contributes to the continuously growing stranglehold on your life. Not suprisingly I'm coming from personal experience, but in a better place now so I can see it for what it was, but when you are in the thick of it, it takes more than just having a good life to break that hold. Keep up the good work Phil, I don't always agree with you but I have always loved that you are open and honest about mental illness, we need more people like that."

When you kill yourself, you're taking the easy way out and leaving everyone who loved you devastated. You're taking you pain, giving up on it and throwing that same pain on everyone you love. It's selfish, and short sighted. I thought about that after my dad (who had no idea I was depressed) told me, if I died it would ruin his life. If you're suicidal, don't do it.

There is no immunity from such diseases, whether rich or poor, and it shows that all of us deserve as a right, Healthcare. There are those in this country that can not afford the type of healthcare Mr. McCain has. There are those who have lost everything they own because of the bills such diseases bring with them, because we can discuss the physical toll these issues cause but forget the medical costs of the cures. And such costs can last a lifetime after. We may at times take for granted the  rights our wonderful country provides us all, but one right as a modern nation has proved elusive. The right to live, knowing that my healthcare is no different then a rich man who also lives in America. That I will not saddle my children in debt because I may suffer from Cancer or some likewise disease that not only causes physical turmoil but also monetary devastation.  That my life is truly equal in worth as the richest in this country because we share in the same healthcare. The sad thing is that this right can be achieved if we can simply look past our differences as Democrats or Republicans and only see ourselves as Americans. And that this is a God given right we all truly deserve. I wish you well Mr. McCain, the road to recovery from such a medical issue is long, I know from experience as my late father suffered from the same ailment. Which affected him till the end of his days, and which devastated a family."

He's a guy who I voted for against Obama...but in the long run wound up disagreeing with more and more as time went on (he is a little too mainstream-republican ... Someone who is very much an \"establishment\" politician...where I like to take each issues as it comes and make my decisions based on the facts...I stay toward the middle, perhaps just right of center...I like to consider myself part of the \"new\"-republican party who has pretty liberal social views for the most part, and relatively conservative economic views...someone who believes in capitalism, but also equality amongst everyone...... I could continue going on and on about my political views, but that's not what I'm trying to comment about ... Anywayyyyyyyy, now ends my rant on politics).....no matter what I thought of his politics, I always saw him as a good man. A man who was truly a hero. Sacrificing his freedom in order to be with him platoon when I believe he was offered an opportunity to be freed considering his rank, but declined in order to stay with his troops in solidarity......and he was also a man who stood by what he believed....he never took undeserved shots at people (see: Phil's clips about Obama)... He seemed to help anyone in need...and he did anything he could in service to the country he loved and would have given his life for.... He is very clearly a fighter, so I hope this is just another fight he can put in his W column."

From a quick internet statistic search it appears Baltimore has the highest murder rate, and one of the highest crime rates in the USA. I can imagine that in this climate the police may have suspicion of certain individuals, and when they planted the drugs they did it with the concept that they \"knew\" that he did drugs, and had committed other crimes. Likely in there minds they are speeding up the prosecution of an individual. This is my suspicion without looking into the history of the victim of the drug plant. This of course does not excuse the drug plant, but a drug plant does not necessarily mean that the victim is innocent. It does not excuse the crime of the police. This probably sounds like a political neutral answer."

He was a professor at a university with a wife, 3 kids, and a house. He had friends and students that would work on his behalf so we would be able to support ourselves, as he was the main source of income in the house.

I share your disgust toward the \"garbage people\" who are hateful. \"How fucking dare you\" is the right response! But you later (and rightly) do not exclude such garbage people  and \"filth\" from the good sentiment of \"you never know what people are going through\" when sharing your attitude on suicide-awareness. The hypothetical person struggling with suicide who you portrayed seems more like a sad person than a hateful one, but the above quotation from you is strong in its use of \"never\" and what I take to be universal scope of all people. Notice this would include hateful people. Of course,  your good suicide-awareness sentiment cannot serve as a license that excuses detestable acts because \"maybe that person is going through a lot right now,\" but perhaps the term \"garbage person\" fails to distinguish sufficiently between the person and her act. Or, meh, maybe it's fine. After all, it's okay to call someone an idiot instead of her acts as idiotic. And it would become cumbersome to talk like that all the time. And there's just something natural and right of closely associating someone with her actions. So maybe keep garbage person, but hope she don't commit suicide anytime soonafter...? Or maybe when denouncing a wrong action, emphasize not that she's awful person (which she may be), but that, although she or her character is awful, she should change in some particular way. In this case, such change could be a broadening of perspective beyond those in one's political camp by noting the good and honorable things McCain has done, or just not wishing death on others. That way, you could recommend change in someone instead of leaving an issue with \"these people are garbage.\" I don't think you committed any egregious wrong here, but in looking for a way to make these two attitudes consistent with one another, we may find a thought or two worth thinking critically about."

He has stated that if he didn't have music, that he'd 100% be dead by now, and that music is his motivation to prevent and vent his turmoil. This instance repeats this routine. He kills himself, and he doesn't realize the same 2nd hand damage is coming down on his wife, his kids, and everyone who looked up to him. Hell, if Cornell's death pushed him that far, the routine continues even there. \n\nI wanted him to live, but not for myself or his selfish routines, but for the people he is responsible for.

Linkin Park, and Chester's amazing vocal talent, touched my soul and helped me realize that life is worth living so much more than ending it all before I had the chance to live.

The purpose of police is to protect and serve the community they work in, and you cannot do that if the community thinks you're sticking up for dishonest cops.  I feel sorry for the officer's families, but it is in the best interest of the police agency and the community to distance themselves from the officer accused of planting evidence.

We started a drug epidemic in this country by giving our greatest generation meth during World War II to keep them awake then we walk away from them. Our country's heroes give their all and suffer for it. We don't take proper care of them. We let them die at VA hospitals. We leave them homeless on the streets. We cause their deaths with chemicals and drugs. We pretend PTSD isn't a major issue while they kill themselves and sometimes others. This is disgusting the way we treat those who answered the call and went to battle for our country so that others wouldn't have to."

It's a similar situation as to what I've been through, but his was a far worse situation than mine. I love Linkin Park, my condolences to the family of Linkin Park, because I'm right here with you guys. Chester was one of my idols (the other being Mike Shinoda) in the music industry. He was a very emotional man, and it really made me feel like I could relate to him. Someone out there understood what it was like. Thank you, Linkin Park. Thank you all for making your music for as long as you did. You were all amazing at what you did, you knew your audience, and you were all good people. I'm gonna miss Chester's voice, his intellect, and his personality. He was such an influential man. But I hope they don't try to replace him. There is no replacement for Chester. (I'm not crying.

All the while, that orange skinned abscess on a warthogs ass was sitting in a country club being protected by his dads influence and...bone spurs. You know, McCain was offered to be set free, due to who his family was and he refused. Who is the loser and the traitor? \n\nOh, fun note. 30 years later, McCain returned to Vietnam and met his captors. And made peace with them."

A good step would be making officers report recreations, so the police can point to written statements saying it was a recreation, for one reason or another.

Before responding to me with extreme anger/outrage, or resorting to name-calling, please read what I am about to say and think about it before reacting.\n\nI'm disgusted by what Chester Bennington did. Part of the reason why I stopped being a hardcore fan of their music many years ago, was when the drama started with Chester. From constantly talking about his abusive childhood to the point where he seemed to be exploiting people's sympathy, to his marital/personal life issues, to his constant illnesses and addictions and various other problems, it became exhausting for me to hear about. It's like every time we turned around, we were hearing about Chester's next big problem. On the surface he seemed like a sweet, humble and loving person, but behind closed doors, I have no doubt that he was destructive not just to himself but to the people around him. People who engage in that much drama cannot help but hurt the people closest to them. At first I was shocked that Chester had committed suicide, but now I'm not even surprised. After his dramatic performance at Chris Cornell's funeral, of course he would hang himself, similar to what Chris did, and of course it would be on Chris's birthday. Anything to go out with a big explosion. Please, fans and others who knew who he was, don't make him into a martyr or a statement for depression and suicide awareness. Chester has seriously hurt his children, his wife, his bandmates, his family and everyone else who poured so much love, time and energy into him through everything. They did not deserve that."

    "commentText": "Wow, just wow. Body cameras on officers are supposed to assure the public that police follow proper procedures and protocol when making arrests and gathering evidence. Instead of assuring the public that officers are acting justly, its done the exact opposite of its intended purpose. The video has put the BPD in a position that the public mistrust may never recover. At this point, the only logical step is to try and assure an increasingly skeptical public that other officers are still acting appropriately, would require having the body cameras rolling regardless, removing the officers ability to tamper with evidence and even then, they are still ways to get around it. Why are stories around planted evidence almost always drug related? Is the temptation to getting a drug conviction so alluring that officers are willing to bend and break the law that they are supposed to uphold just to get a solid case when otherwise they wouldn't? Seeing stories like this makes me feel like the war on drugs has turned some officers into terrorists of minority groups who can and do destroy lives at will."

The man is responsible for killing good American people, trying to shut down the ACA instead of expanding it. Maybe his brush with medical expenses will help him understand that other people can find themselves with cancer and may not have the money McCain does. What do they do then?? Let's be honest here, the man fought in an unjust war, the man got captured by a state fighting for independence in the same way our nation did over 250 years ago. He did not fight for freedom or justice, no one in that war did. Once he was out of the war what did he do? He pushed for more unnecessary wars in the middle east, which killed more good, innocent Americans.  McCain is a traitor to this nation, not for fighting in Vietnam, but for everything he has done since. I don't wish death upon him. But I can't force myself to feel sorry for this garbage human. Phil, when someone's actions lead to the death of thousands maybe millions of my fellow Americans, I do not believe they deserve my condolences when they are on their death bed.\n\nP.S.

You can see that her first name is scribbled over with red pen in an effort to cover the name up. \nSecond of all, I am completely heart broken over Chester's death. I used to listen to Linkin Park all the time when I was in middle and high school. Back then, I was emotionally very unstable and somewhat suicidal. The music Chester and his band created told me that it was okay to not be okay and that I would get through things eventually. It just devastates me that Chester is gone.

One does not just decide randomly on this day that he will plant something and never had the idea before.

Is it wrong to wish a priest who rapes children die of a naturally occurring disease??\n\nNow, replace church with government and priest with John McCain, and think through it again. \n\nYes, McCain is better than some of the other republicans. Yes, he's better than a lot of Democrats. But to cut him any slack because he got cancer is disingenuous. \nTake a look at his voting record: \nhttps://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/53270/john-mccain-iii#.WXFNfYiGP4Y\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/john-mccain/\nHe voted against banning arms sales to terrorists. He voted to take money away from planned parenthood. That one act alone will cost lives. He voted for the Dakota pipeline that risks countless lives, and shows no love to native people. Not even tolerance of them or their sacred sites. He cares about money.  Well, his money. Corporate money. Like when he voted against minimum wage fairness, or paycheck fairness. \n\nJust because he did some good things, does not make him a good guy. \nI'm pretty sure Eva Braun thought Hitler had redeeming qualities too, but that doesn't make him acceptable. \n\nThe people happy his dying are fine. It's an opinion they have every right to. So long as they didn't give him the cancer.... his donors probably did that."

If found to have planted evidence he should immediately be thrown in prison with a term equal or higher than the total sum of the terms of every single person he put away for drug related offenses.

Were they really carrying a bag of drugs around the whole time (in the cruiser on the way there, etc.)? Where did they get the drugs in the first place?\n\nTo me, it seems the most likely explanation is that they did indeed find the drugs on the property, then decided to stage the event for the camera. Which is stupid, imo, and morally questionable... but it doesn't change the fact that the guy they were investigating broke the law. However, I think the ultimate takeaway here is that body cameras should be recording and saving all footage while the officer is on duty. The storage tech certainly exists for this to be possible."

Mental illness is never black and white, there are so many factors that from the outside looking in can be overlooked or remain unnoticed.

From all that I have seen he is a man who cares about the American people and wishes to see only good come of whatever politics he supports for the most amount of people possible. He is a war hero, and a seemingly genuinely good person. Like with anything in politics, he is certainly not always right in his approaches, and I have disagreed with him wholeheartedly in the past, but there is a major difference between politics and person. Anyone that wishes him dead is severely misguided and quite frankly an absolute idiot, only looking to stir up drama and bring themselves attention, obviously extremely uneducated on the life and person of John McCain.

    "commentText": "John McCain is a monster on a scale rarely seen. When a family who suffered from the same condition he is now inflicted with sent him a letter pleading for him to back a bill that wouldn't fuck with their insurance, he gave them a cold response saying they should basically go pound sand and move to another state, because he didn't believe healthcare was a right.\n\nMister McCain also has spread terror, and violence around the world for decades. Going to regions of the world and trying to fund (and meet) with Jihadis, who were going to be people fighting for the interests of his lobbyists. He then denounces the same sorts of people who he openly backs against other regions (Syria, Iran, Russia, ect), in order to make it appear as though he loves and cares for America. The man is a two faced snake, a murderer in my estimation, a war profiteer, and war criminal. Quite honestly, as harsh as this sounds, the man is ancient and was going to die sometime, but rarely is it so fitting that a piece of human garbage gets quite what they deserve.\n\nThat being said, his family obviously will be upset by this. The sins of John McCain do not represent anyone he happens to be related to. The pain they are feeling is real, and they deserve sympathy, because to them I'm sure Mister McCain isn't the slimy, treasonous, war criminal that he is to the rest of the world. Nor is he the man who  callously informed them they weren't worth saving, and they had no right to live.\n\nThis isn't a liberal, or conservative thing. This is a human decency thing. And I realize that my comments on saying that John McCain is genuinely getting what he deserves for being a bloodthirsty piece of shit, lowers my standing among others. But I'm going to say the unpopular thing at this time where people intend to try and show sympathy. Because I am offering a fraction of the 'sympathy' that Mister McCain has shown to his victims abroad, and at home. Sadly, I realize people can't suffer more after they die, as they'll not exist. But should I be wrong, I hope these next words are prophetic. \n\nFuck John McCain, may he become the Queen of the Devil after he gets to Hell."

When we look at what is happening, any time a child survives to adult hood, only to take their own life, is unacceptable. I am not saying his actions are unacceptable, I am saying not doing enough to help him is unacceptable. We can do more. That is why I have created #MenSpeakYourRape.

If you're advocating for a policy to take health insurance for Americans when you know this will result in numerous deaths when there's no justifiable reason for it (look at that military spending, you can't justify cutting healthcare while that exists) you are a hateful person and the people attacking him are not unreasonable to feel towards him how he acted towards them."

I am very interested in police work so I know a little bit of this and no matter what his reasons were, he should not do this, if this had been handled the real way he should have turned on the body camera the second he realized that he had found it, because when things are moved around and things are edited like they were here, it hurts your case in the event of a trial, not even only in terms of giving testimony, at this point the stories may not line up anymore and it will hurt your case. This is something that police officers are taught because it is just a good idea.

People commit murder, people commit arson, people commit robberies. People die by suicide. Saying people 'commit suicide' simplify the issues and demonize the memory of those lost. Yes, suicide clearly effects not just those who die by it, but people around them. In a very 'in a vacuum' way, it is selfish; but it's so much more complex than dismissing it as such.\n\nI see a lot of people saying how selfish suicide is, but people need to understand the complexities of an illness so deep that it overrides a human's basic will to survive. Everything we do on a primal level is to keep our bodies alive. Everything our bodies do, is to perpetuate it's life. Now consider how much fucking despair someone has to be able to override our primary evolutionary command of 'keep this body alive' just to end their suffering. I'm not saying you can't see it as a bit of selfishness, but to not also acknowledge everything else about it is a disservice to all that have been lost and all those who suffer with illnesses who have considered it."

Died by suicide could be used instead. This is how we indicate any other cause of death.

Only 134 killed during the explosion and fire afterwards.\n\nNow for his being shot down and capture, did you know he was disobeying orders and in an area he was not supposed to be in and was outside the flight paramiters set for the area due to the SAM sites in the area.\n\nAbout his time as a POW is fairly well-known.  He would frequently report fellow POWs  to the North Vietnamese for favors or extra food.  He recorded messages that were broadcast by the North Vietnamese to lower US soldier morale.  He provided classified information about US bombing tactics and airial ground support, helping the North Vietnamese evade bombings and infiltrate South Vietnamese areas.  He debriefed not only with the North Vietnamese but also the Russians and Chinese about US aircraft, tactics, and who really knows what else.  Worst of all he signed and was the only POW to sign a statement claiming the USA and it's soldiers were war criminals and committing war crimes throughout Vietnam.  Makes you wonder why he won't unseal and release his military and POW records.\n\nSide know did nobody notice that no other POW campaigned with or for McCain.  None of them recorded TV or radio adds in support of McCain either.\n\nThe woman that stood by him through his whole POW imprisonment was soon divorced when he got home for a younger wealthier one whose family promised to help him run for political office.  Guess money and power mean more that love and loyalty to McCain. \n\nDo we need talk about the Keating Five Savings and Loan Scandal and the thousands of people who lost millions of dollars in the economical depressed 1980's.\n\nHis treatment of current serving military and veterans is absolutely horrible.  I personally have experienced both as I met as an Airman and as a veteran at the VA.  All you have to look at is his record of voting when it comes to pay and benefits for servicemen and benefits and care for veterans through the VA or other agencies.\n\nThe list goes on and on over several other issue, but I think this poves the point well enough that McCain is not honorable, a hero, brave, or holier than thou.  He was just a piss poor seaman, opportunist, run of the mill corrupt politician."

Since the release of the extra footage creates doubt, any and all related evidence should be inadmissible. If he was recreating the find then that sucks and it was a huge error on the part of the officer. If the camera, when activated, grabs footage from 30 secs before and immediately saves it, then that should have been all he needed as evidence. But since he did not use it that way and tried to recreate the find and the footage only created doubt, it should definitely be inadmissible moving forward and if there was no other evidence or proof of any other crime, then the criminal in question should have all charges dismissed. Moving forward this situation should be used as an example for officers of what not to do and should help teach how the body cam's activation feature works and how it can assist in providing evidence in the future. If the criminal in question is dismissed of all charges, chances are he will continue to make mistakes in the future and it will eventually catch up with him. And if not, then maybe this whole case will act as a catalyst for this guy's rehabilitation."

To everyone who may want to say that Chester was either \"selfish\" or \"ungreatful\" for taking his own life. No, just no you are reducing a person's complex and typically paradoxical personal hell to \"They are just selfish, they didn't care about the people who they would hurt.\" Or \"Why would someone with his life ever think about killing themselves.\". That is wrong. If someone you love reaches out to you when they are suicidal or just hear you say those things about suicide, you may just be driving them closer to the edge. You are basically saying why don't you just feel a little more shame and disappointment in yourself then you already do. People in a state of deep depression tend to not think rationally about what/who they have in their lives. They just know that they are in terrible amounts of pain and feel helpless to stop it."

There are soooo many cops in America I cant really say how many there is, and these are a few small story's of some doing something bad.

The suspension and investigation is a good start, be interesting to see what comes of it, if anything. i dont 100% believe he planted it, but his lack of care with evidence, hiding it again for the camera, etc, is poor police work.

So I'm working to make sure that I am classy about this. \n\nJohn McCain went down for brain cancer during the death of the healthcare bill.  Shortly after news that the bill would not have enough votes to move forward, we heard about John McCain's sudden illness.  He was taken to a hospital and given the best possible healthcare, and hopefully he does pull through.  \n\nJohn McCain, however, is not on our public healthcare system.  These people are legislating a healthcare system that they don't even use.  This kind of care is incredibly expensive and currently no available or affordable option exists for me, or anyone I know personally. I'm not saying what side any one should be on; just wanting to call out the disparity between those who are deliberating the laws, and those of us who actually have to live with them."

I don't know, that just seems peculiar to me that he'd make that kind of mistake if he knew. But then he should have known, so.

Mclain's former POW camp is now a museum, pretty standard museum until you get to a room in the middle, where to my surprise you see all these USAA uniforms etc and a big old exhibit on Mclain. It was really eyeopening seeing this as Vietnam is still quite (understandably) bitter about the war, the museum was called the american war crimes museum. Perhaps this exhibit was cashing in on the fact he was a presidential candidate IDK but I was intrigued. Fast forward to last night and reading peoples comments on him in the reddit post and I was astounded and emotionally moved. The integrity he had in that clip you showed is pure class and is how election campaigns should be run, debating each candidates strongest arguments, not attacking personal flaws.

About that student in Florita, I don't see anything wrong there, didn't mention who she was, it was humorous, didn't even got aggressively back at her for what she denied/admitted; basically (many) Universities are grooming intolerants with a fanatic interpretation of \"everything you say and do can be hurtful and therefore, it's better to curtail, constraint and ban everything (as long as someone puts a convincing act of victimhood)\", a culture of a de facto unilateral entitlement for aggressive (or even violent) actions after unilateral perceptions and interpretations. This obviously is merely an extrapolation of an already favoring (American) culture. Hence, and within that violent note too, the reaction against that senator aren't surprising (even within the realm of extreme disagreement) what sometimes showcases the huge contradiction of values (you cannot eat the cannibal to fight against cannibalism, while claiming that the cannibal deserves to be eaten)."

Cops are searching the car and have the 2 victims(?) in handcuffs. one officer stops searching to question the people and officer 2 goes to his car for a few seconds then goes back to the suspects car and then proceeds to look around both the car and to see who is watching (I guess missing me) and then \"finds\" whatever drugs it was. He walks over and the 2 suspects/victims start yelling \"that's not mine\" I couldn't see the cop pull the drugs out of his pocket or anything but to me it was fairly obvious it looked like he pulled it out of the back floor board not really hidden or anything. Who was I going to tell? The police? Hell no then they will find \"my\" drugs. The older I get the more I realize how corrupt the US is and the more I want to leave this planet."

Most Colleges charge a handful of fees to attend beside tuition, health cards, parking fees, student bodies fees ETC.

I detest the selfishness of people and though my isolation from my misunderstanding have lacked any acceptance. So I currently strive to bring a world of logical thought and selfless ideology of not a country but the human race. This obviously does take well with anyone focused on just looking out for themselves of a small group like a family so I have almost never seen positive feedback and has led to myself being suicidal at times. I simply see no reason to live in this world and even now all I do is work to stay alive and then eat away time with video games wishing and hoping that some tragic accident may end my eventual and perpetual suffering.

He could have even taken video of where and how he found it later as long as he represented it as a recreation from the start. Officers testimonies get convictions all the time.  Whether or not the officer did originally find the drugs in the alley way(which I have serious doubts he actually did) he still lied and perjured himself.

John McCain isn't a perfect politician, nobody is. But the people who wish death upon him are (and I mean this to be offensive) sub-human. I had a relative go through cancer and die after a very intense fight.

That means we all expect them to abide by a higher ethical standard then most, since upholding the law and protecting the public is their job. They broke that trust and failed at their job when they chose to plant evidence at a crime scene, regardless of their excuses for doing so.\n\nSure, it is possible they've been trying to arrest that guy for drug charges for years and he's well known to be a drug dealer. Who knows, he may even be one. The problem is, when we allow cops to cross that line, how far do we push it? How far is enough? Or do we let them go so far that anyone they want to arrest, they just have to accuse of a crime, plant some evidence to support their charges and it's a done deal? That's NOT their job, to bully and punish the innocent and guilty alike! Their job is to find people who break laws, are a threat to society and arrest them so dangerous people can be separated out from the rest so we're not put at risk by their actions. We have separate courts and a due process to make sure they don't make mistakes and if they do, that those mistakes are caught before a innocent person's life is ruined or (in the case of death penalties, ended).\n\nOf course, that's assuming that dude actually ever did anything wrong, which he also may very well not have, and those cops just wanted to make an arrest so bad they planted evidence so they could get the stat. He may have been a drug dealer in the past, who did his time came out and is now living clean and is a law abiding citizen now.\n\nThe problem is, when cops plant evidence, they cast doubt as to whether or not the person they arrested committed any crime. How can you tell if the evidence is faked? Now we'll never know if the people those cops involved in that evidence planting ever committed any crimes because we can't trust their evidence or testimony. Now we'll never know the truth.\n\nThose cops have done the city of Baltimore, their police department, any people wrongfully convicted of any crimes they investigated,  and any victims of any crimes true criminals were NOT convicted of because of their actions. For every crime where an innocent person was wrongfully convicted, there is a true perpetrator who goes undetected and unconvinced, free to continue to commit more crimes and hurt more people. For every person wrongfully convicted of a crime is a victim of a crime themselves, being found guilty and having their lives ruined for something they didn't even do.\n\nThis is just wrong on so many levels I can't excuse those cops no matter what circumstances may have lead to them making that choice to plant evidence."

Speaking of the system, how much taxpayer money will now be allocated to investigate all of these open cases that they were apart of? Moreover, if the 3rd party investigators find suspicious activity in the an open/ongoing cases, then they're going to have to investigate (reopen) some of the closed ones too. How many criminals is this going to let get away, and how many innocent people were wrongfully accused? Why is it that people can't seem to think beyond themselves? No man is an island.

People are SUPPOSED to grow and they aren't doing it well if they're lashing out or retaliating. A mature man would have put that letter in a shoebox in the closet and moved on.

If you think Trump is bad Arizona should have unleashed \"Sheriff Joe\" on America as well and then you'd have some idea of what bad truly is.   And a war hero?   Do you even have ANY clue at all about what Vietnam was truly all about?  Well here is just one infinitesimal feature of what that war did to your great America and in what condition those soldiers had to come in while being pelted with rotten eggs, vegetables and garbage and being yelled at with the words \"Baby KILLER! Rapists! Village burners!  Murders!\"  :  *1966 to 1969, the armed forces had used 225 million tablets of stimulants, mostly Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), an amphetamine derivative that is nearly twice as strong as the Benzedrine used in the Second World War.  The annual consumption of Dexedrine per person was 21.1 pills in the navy, 17.5 in the air force, and 13.8 in the army. “We had the best amphetamines available and they were supplied by the U.S. government,” said Elton Manzione, a member of a long-range reconnaissance platoon (or Lurp). He recalled a description he’d heard from a navy commando, who said that the drugs “gave you a sense of bravado as well as keeping you awake. Every sight and sound was heightened. You were wired into it all and at times you felt really invulnerable.” Soldiers in units infiltrating Laos for a four-day mission received a medical kit that contained, among other items, 12 tablets of Darvon (a mild painkiller), 24 tablets of codeine (an opioid analgesic), and six pills of Dexedrine. Before leaving for a long and demanding expedition, members of special units were also administered steroid injections. Research has found that 3.2 percent of soldiers arriving in Vietnam were heavy amphetamine users; however, after one year of deployment, this rate rose to 5.2 percent. In short, the administration of stimulants by the military contributed to the spread of drug habits that sometimes had tragic\nconsequences—because amphetamine, as many veterans claimed, increased aggression as well as alertness. Some remembered that when the effect of speed faded away, they were so irritated that they felt like shooting “children in the streets.”*"

This is not one of those times. \n\nEverything about this information seems to show the officers looking for evidence not being able to find it and then planting it. This kind of lazy police work happens. \n\nOne of the reasons this can happen is if the evidence was found in a manner that violates a persons rights or in a manner that would make it inadmissible as evidence officer my \"stage\" a way to find it \"legally\" later in order to try to prevent someone guilty from going free because someone screwed up on a legal procedure or because they did something illegal. \n\nIn this case there are three possibilities. \n1 The officers found it legally and then \"staged\" it for the cameras but didn't make note of that at all either in their reports or on the video. \n2 The officers found the it in a manner that made it inadmissible even though it legitimately proves the person is guilty and then staged it to make admissible. \n3 They officers planted the evidence to try to make the case a slam dunk, or pin it on the person they \"think\" is guilty. \n\nOption 1 is stupidity and will be used (had the charges not been dropped) to get the guy off anyway. Officers should be let go\nOption 2 is stupidity, illegal and, hurts the integrity of the uniform. Officers should be let go and prosecuted. \nOption 3 is stupidity, illegal and shows the officers have no integrity. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

Professional help and medication only helps you live with the problem and identifying it not resolving it.\n\nIf you want to help someone with depression then tell their friends and family to get off their asses. Put some effort into finding the cause and actually help them resolve what's causing the depression if they want that person in their lives. \n\nEveryone always passes the buck, oh someone else will do it, someone else will resolve it and then nothing ever gets resolved.

This video about the police planting evidence is only a 1000000th of what police officers do around the USA. this is only a crack in the glass of what actually goes on. The police here in the USA have so much leniency that they feel they can do anything, even kill someone and get barely any punishment. The only way for these things to change is to punish crooked cops just as regular civilians, but that won't happen, because the media glorifies the police officers. Us as civilians need to stand again this in order to get change, but we are wired to not do that. So sadly, all we can do it watch and look at these events, hoping for change but it will never happen."

Your chipper and informed demeanor is amazing. \n\nThank you for the mention about depression and suicide. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 years old, and put on Prozac. It sucked but I dealt with it. I still deal with it today, only without any medication. On the outside, I am always smiling and cracking jokes and my friends think nothing is wrong, and it was like that when I was younger. What people didn't realize is that I had actually attempted suicide twice, both times \"Dumb luck\" saved me. Recently, now being 36, i had a severe episode that actually frightened my fiance. She had never seen me that dark, and she was afraid I was going to hurt myself again. She had already known about the other times, so she sat me down and asked if I wanted to get help again.  I told her that I would come out of it, I always do. This is a sad occurrence for me though, because it had been years since I was hit that hard. I broke down and balled my eyes out with her. I have been down before and I am always worried that the mental disorder is going to win out. My family are my new Prozac and they truly do help. \n\nPeople don't know what truly happens with depression unless they have experienced it first hand. Thank you for the little bit of encouragement, even if not directed at me personally, it made me feel better. Keep up the great work."

I'm not a police officer....but I was under the impression that those things are on the moment a cop arrives on scene/responds to a call or is on their way to the scene. And if they aren't recording video due to memory storage limitations, they are still recording audio at all times.\n\nBody-cams should be MANDATORY for all precincts in the entire nation. If for any reason the body cam fails to record, that cop should be vigorously investigated. Sure, it might cost a lot to give all cops body-cams across the country, but I think it would even out with all the damn lawsuits that are paid out to people who are victimized by cops!\n\nI'm also getting real sick of the words \"administrative leave\". FIRE THESE CORRUPT PIGS!!! Or, at the very least, give them suspension WITHOUT pay!!!! That'll motivate them to stop messing with innocent civilians. Half the corrupt shit these officers do...they do it because they know they can get away with it. Their boss will defend them to the ends of the earth.

He's rich and for the rich America is the best for near medical miracles, but the middle class and poor have no access to that type of care and they are left to die, go into extreme debt, or both, so I'm not going to call for McCain to be beheaded in Time Square but I'm not going to feel sad that he has cancer. Yes he was a great soldier and fought for this country, but he also called for more war, wars that killed thousands of our own soldiers , every single one just as brave and killed tens of thousand of innocent civilians."

He has fought other Republicans on issues he felt strongly about before (such as torture because he was tortured) hopefully having experienced this first hand as well will give him a little sympathy for those that wouldn't be able to afford the operation he got on tax payer money."

Yes, he had great moments like that, he also had his stance against employment protections leading to the homelessness and in some cases deaths of LGBTQ people. He advocated for don't ask don't tell which resulted in numerous assaults and, in some rare cases, murder over people's orientations, prevented others from being people who served their country which you found a selling point, and cost many their position and retirement after THEY HAD served their country...\n\nHe pulled some massively toxic stuff around \"socialism\" and stood against things being put into practice to save our lives and punish those who take them. Yet, despite his actions going in a direction that was indirection killing us (repercussions to his choices rather than directly from him) those people are not to wish death back?\n\nTo be fair, i reserve those feelings for select few, my own previous mayor here in Toronto, Rob Ford, one of them. I watched people fall into insanity and starvation while i was homeless over the cuts that took away our housing, training, and services and McCain stood for much of the same. I lived the repercussions of those actions, and you don't make it through a hell like that wishing well to the people who supported it."

In addition to that they should make it where the data collected by the body cams is stored and processed by a third party that is not connected or controlled by the police department or the prosecutor's office. Perhaps make it a company that is contracted on a state level to do it, and monitored by the state court system. The footage of all searches and investigations should then be made available to both the prosecutor and the defense. Also make it law where if it was not caught on dash or body cam then it can not be used in court. To many cops have been getting away with lies for years. So to me it is time to stop giving their testimony the benefit of the doubt in court."

This particular student is just some jackass who's imitating a meme; poor company, but not doing anything illegal.\n\nThe news of Sen John McCain upsets me for a few reasons; it bothers me that in the heat of an argument over healthcare we have a senator go down and get a very expensive procedure done, which will he completely covered on the taxpayers dime. If he were John McCain the plumber, he likely would never have set foot in a hospital because of the expenses. \nIt also upsets me that people are cheering and hoping for this man to die; I may detest some of Sen McCain's politics, but he's one of the few Republican senators I respect as a person, because I also believe he loves this country and the people in it. \nThank you Senator McCain; get well soon.

I didn't do either because I was too scared and weak to go through with it. I'm so glad I didn't. Now I can't recall exactly what sparked it, perhaps a movie or a video or something, but I just realized that what I was doing, where I was going, was dangerous. I decided to take control and get better. Looking back, I can't remember what exactly I did, but I remember that I ate an Oreo and told all the thoughts in my head that told me that I'm disgusting and ugly and unlovable to fuck off. I decided to go back to the gym. I lost some friends but I've moved on and I've gotten better. When I was struggling with my depression, I thought it would never get better and, like Philip said, it was like a blanket strangling and crushing me at the time but I just want you, whoever you are reading this, to know that you'll get through it.

I want to say more training, considering most American cops spend nineteen weeks at the police academy where other countries have their police force study for two to three years, but that still doesn't touch the issue of the corruption that runs deep within the police force, the rising militarization and feelings of separation from the public (they are straying farther and farther from 'protect and serve' and closer to 'us vs them').

    "commentText": "A lot of people on twitter are retweeting a video of McCain rebutting a supporter in one of his rallies who said Obama is Arab. McCain said, no he's a decent person as an example of McCain being an honorable man. I think, rightly so, arabs, like myself, took issue with the praise of that video because it assumes that Arab is an insult. I reacted emotionally due to the negative stereotypes that exists about arabs and muslims being terrorists. While I do think that there are people who would see it that way, I do realise now that McCain was misinterpreted and taken out of context. He was refuting the racist and false notions against Obama as a villain. I'm sure if he was writing a statement he would elucidate his thoughts more clearly. He is no more a racist nor an islamaphobe than any political candidate who supports war in the Middle East. That being, not necessarily so, just a war mongerer who believes they are doing what is best for their country in foreign policy according to short-sighted and misguided political strategies. So I guess what I'm saying is, fellow arabs, don't get your panties twisted in a bunch. McCain is as reasonable of a republican as republicans get. He's a patriot before that word became derogatory by people who have claimed and misused it. I wish him the speediest of recoveries and hope other republicans take his integrity as inspiration."

A friend's uncle had brain cancer and he told me how heart wrenching it was for the entire family to have to see him go through that experience. So, no, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. And I never really followed politics that closely at the time, so I never saw that clip til just now, but it brought tears to my eyes as he was talking about Obama like a friend. Like some good old-fashioned friendly competition when you ran against your best friend at school for student body president. I won't sink to their level and wish harm on the hateful trolls dancing in the streets about this tragic news because I believe karma will kick in at some point and then they'll realize their mistake in putting this much hatred into the world. Here's an interesting idea for a social experiment...when you see such a hateful statement on Facebook or Twitter or now I'm seeing LinkedIn has become a political platform, instead of reacting with an equally hateful statement, just say \"I love you.\" This is sure to piss the person off and will more than likely confuse them, but when they reply again, simply repeat \"I love you.\" but don't go into a long dissertation about it. Just that one line. Get enough people doing that for every hateful comment out there and the I love you's will flood the posts. And even when it's said in jest, who doesn't want to \"hear\" someone say I love you? :)"

I'm so glad I decided not to, and I'm still here.  I want to live my life in a way I can influence others and help others.  I want to take from this sad time and learn and try to take from their and his example and do what I can to be a good in this world.  I advise everyone to do what you can, even you feel it's not much, reach out to those you know, show others you care for them.  We don't always know what others are going through, but we can be there still.  I will truly miss Chester, I am grateful to him, and his and Linkin Park's music.  Goodbye Chester, and my thoughts and prayers go out to you, your friends and family.  Also I want others to remember, if you ever get to this point, ever consider this, there are others that care for you, I may not know you, but I care for you.  As someone who's gone through these emotions, I especially care for those who think this.  You may not feel you amount to much, but you do, you have a purpose, you can do something for someone else, even if it doesn't seem like it now.  We are here for each other and care."

The idea that police walk around with the drugs looking to plant them in random places just to keep black people down seems stupid because if that was the case every black person would be in jail before video became so normalized. Not that this didn't ever happen in the past but unlike a black person with drugs it is an extraordinary claim which requires extraordinary evidence. There is no evidence of that here."

I'm glad he got cancer.

It makes him a vastly inferior human being. This man fought in an illegal war, suffered immensely in it, and then decided when he got back and entered office \"Yeah, I want to send countless other people to suffer like I did and die like my friends did so some corporations can make bank selling weapons to the government.

I can only hope that he takes this recovery time to think about not returning to the Senate since this is such an aggressive cancer with such a high mortality rate. He's given us his all and then some. I hope he thinks about retiring and enjoying his retirement, he's more than earned it in my eyes. This isn't said in hate, a wish for him to leave a job he loves or a wish for his death; but in a wish that if this cancer does return and prove to be fatal, his family deserves all of the time they have left with him to themselves. He's served his country and served it well long enough. Whatever he decides to do I respect that choice. I only hope that with such a horrible diagnosis and long term prognosis, he feels he can retire and spend this time with his family and fighting this cancer for as long and as well as he can.

You really think cops join because they want to make the world a better place?  I've had personal experiences where the police are unjust, aggressive, are allowed to lie, and treat you worse if you express your rights as a sovereign citizen of the United States of America.  I used to have all the respect in the world for cops and used to understand how necessary they were.  Then, reality smacked me in the face.  They dont represent good.  They dont represent the law.  Its all about the MONEY and meeting their quotas.  It's a money racketeering system that's beyond flawed.  You can enforce and represent the almighty rules and laws but have a right to legally lie at the same time?  How does that make any sense?  Being a police office should not grant you extra privileges above the law like speeding for instance.  I see cops speed all the time without having their lights on.  People are getting fed up. \n\n I dont believe in this whole cops versus black people hysteria either.  They're against everyone and I promise you... there is no white privilege unless you've got money.  I know from experience.  I had been falsely accused of crimes I did not commit...I was harassed and treated like absolute shit for 2 and a half years before it finally got dismissed without going to trial.  Saddest part is, when you get arrested for something you didnt do, going to jail and having to be bailed out for multiple felonious crimes is really expensive.  Even if you get it dropped, dismissed or take it to trial and are found not guilty you are never reimbursed.  It's never gone.  Your name was in the news and on the internet forever that you were charged with whatever crimes were committed and it looks terrible at first glance until you find out the details of the situation.  You dont get to have fox news call you and tell you they're sorry for plastering your face all over the news.  Or do you get to have google take down those articles when googling your real name.   I hate the justice system with a passion that burns hotter than a thousand suns.  When I think about it, it makes me sick to my core knowing what happened to me and knowing it's happening to others out there.  The key is knowing that violence wont solve anything but something has to be done."

Cancer is a terrible disease, and i will keep McCain in my thoughts, ive had many family members go through this and it is so very hard to watch happen, i have an aunt that had had a dozen surgeries on her face, to the point where she can barely talk and has to drink all her foods through a straw... these situations are hard and i wish death upon nobody! i dont support the death penalty because of this, we owe everyone the right to rehabilitate, no matter what theyve done, but i saw a post on facebook that made me think a little bit, we have leaders voting on whether or not to repeal Obamacare without a replacement, these people are voting to take away healthcare when they have one of the best healthcare systems in the world! this country is filled with contradictions, men and women get to vote on whether or not they pay for my inhalers while they get top of the line treatment everyday! makes me wonder how these people can sleep at night doing these things\n3.

This email was creepily sent to NOT ONLY the old email address that he knew from back when we were dating, but to my campus email address as well (we both go to the same college even though we stopped dating when I was a senior in high school and he was a sophomore in college). Since I am an English major, I debated sending his \"apology\" back to him with corrections in his grammar and vague statements. Especially when he treated me like I was the side chick when I was his girlfriend in high school before he ever met this girl in college. But all he had to say about gas-lighting me, lying to me, and just all around being an emotionally abusive person was that he \"treated me wrong\". But I decided not to because I had gone my two years in college avoiding him and conscientiously acting like he didn't exist for my own mental and emotional safety because talking to him gives him, in his mind, the clearance to come back into my life and be manipulative again and it's not worth it.\n\nBut I commend that guy and the college was way out of line to do something like that when he wasn't setting out to attack her. In my personal opinion, she reached out to him for an answer and she got one that she just didn't like. It would be one thing if he randomly and actively pursued her and was attacking her, but he didn't. He only responded to something she sent to him."

In any other profession if there is a problem with some or many of a profession there will be others pointing it out, trying to change the wrongs and so on.

I still have grief for my mother who passed away 10 years ago on October 8th 2007. It has been hard  time without her but one shining light that helped me with my grief was Linkin Park's music. Chester's words of anger, sadness, loss and acceptance helped me get stronger and move on. I hope Chester is up there with his buddy Chris playing music for the heavens, letting us know they are at peace and when we go we'll see one awesome concert. Thank you and Goodnight"

The other person I somewhat watch for stories similar to this may make a video but I kind of doubt it, we'll just see. \n\nBut if the story is as it sounds, it does need to be talked about, it does need to be addressed, and it should not be swept under the rug.

I would, however, like to see his narcissistic bubble burst and for him to fully realize what a buffoon he is in most people's eyes rather than the upstanding deal maker and statesman he believes himself to be, and that the sycophants he surrounds himself with reinforce.

Having experienced that as a white woman with a previously clean record, I'm inclined to feel that sometimes it's personal. Could even be a pride thing. Wanting to be praised for getting a criminal/dealer off the street. Either way, it's extremely wrong and upsetting. They are altering someone's life and future either way.

But I think in the same light unless it comes out that these men were actively and unquestionably planting evidence, the punishment should be within reason of a workplace error,."

As he walks back to the alley you can hear the other officers laughing, which might be because it looks stupid to \"re-enact\" it. \n\nJust my 2c, he obviously very well could have planted the drugs, but I think its nice to try and have a more open mind."
